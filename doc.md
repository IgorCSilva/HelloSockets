# Phoenix Channels

## Chapter 2
### Project setup

Creating project:
<br>
- `mix phx.new hello_sockets --no-ecto`

Understand phoenix channels:
<br>
- `mix help phx.gen.channel`

Creating phoenix channel called User:
<br>
- `mix phx.gen.channel User`

Running this command will create theses files:
* creating lib/hello_sockets_web/channels/user_channel.ex
* creating test/hello_sockets_web/channels/user_channel_test.exs
* creating test/support/channel_case.ex

If socket handler is not find, the prompt will ask for create:

* The default socket handler - HelloSocketsWeb.UserSocket - was not found.
* Do you want to create it? [Yn] Y

Now, the following files will be created:
* creating lib/hello_sockets_web/channels/user_socket.ex
* creating assets/js/user_socket.js

- Add the handler to endpoint file:
```elixir
  socket "/socket", HelloSocketsWeb.UserSocket,
    websocket: true,
    longpoll: false
```

- For the front-end integration, you need to import the `user_socket.js` in your `assets/js/app.js` file:
<br>
`import "./user_socket.js"`


### Understand what happens

Run project:
- `mix phx.server`

Now, go in browser and access `http://localhost:4000`. Inspecting the page (right button click and select Inspect) in Network tab, we can see the WebSockets(WS) connections. If necessary, reload the page.

We may see a default phoenix websocket connection, for hot-reload, and the connection labeled `websocket?token=undefined&vsn=2.0.0`.

A WebSocket starts its life as a normal web request that becomes "upgraded" to a WebSocket.

Right-click on `websocket?token=undefined&vsn=2.0.0`, and copy as cURL.
We will have this:
```bash
curl 'ws://localhost:4000/socket/websocket?token=undefined&vsn=2.0.0' \
  -H 'Pragma: no-cache' \
  -H 'Origin: http://localhost:4000' \
  -H 'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9' \
  -H 'Sec-WebSocket-Key: PAlvCbC8VR7NbGH4NmeYPA==' \
  -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/100.0.4896.75 Safari/537.36' \
  -H 'Upgrade: websocket' \
  -H 'Sec-WebSocket-Extensions: permessage-deflate; client_max_window_bits' \
  -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
  -H 'Cookie: _hello_sockets_key=SFMyNTY.g3QAAAABbQAAAAtfY3NyZl90b2tlbm0AAAAYR3ZyTVFURnk3NVA4dXkwR1VFanZhM3Ex.yuPTZBAyJsdtwJWLreroH8mb2tTRK1JKVvabRiYwiHg' \
  -H 'Connection: Upgrade' \
  -H 'Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13' \
  --compressed
```

Replace ws:// with http://, add -i flag and run the following curl command in terminal:
```bash
curl -i 'http://localhost:4000/socket/websocket?token=undefined&vsn=2.0.0' \
  -H 'Pragma: no-cache' \
  -H 'Origin: http://localhost:4000' \
  -H 'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9' \
  -H 'Sec-WebSocket-Key: PAlvCbC8VR7NbGH4NmeYPA==' \
  -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/100.0.4896.75 Safari/537.36' \
  -H 'Upgrade: websocket' \
  -H 'Sec-WebSocket-Extensions: permessage-deflate; client_max_window_bits' \
  -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
  -H 'Cookie: _hello_sockets_key=SFMyNTY.g3QAAAABbQAAAAtfY3NyZl90b2tlbm0AAAAYR3ZyTVFURnk3NVA4dXkwR1VFanZhM3Ex.yuPTZBAyJsdtwJWLreroH8mb2tTRK1JKVvabRiYwiHg' \
  -H 'Connection: Upgrade' \
  -H 'Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13' \
  --compressed
```

Our web request has received a 101 HTTP response from the server, which indecates that the connection rotocol changes from http to a WebSocket.
In server terminal we can see the log:
```bash
[info] CONNECTED TO HelloSocketsWeb.UserSocket in 100Âµs
  Transport: :websocket
  Serializer: Phoenix.Socket.V2.JSONSerializer
  Parameters: %{"token" => "undefined", "vsn" => "2.0.0"}
```

The diagram of the WebSocket connection:
```puml
Client -> Server : http upgraded request.
Server -> Client : http 101 response.
Client <-> Server : Bidirectional messages.
```

The connection cannot be upgraded with cURL, so we'll move back to DevTools for seeing the data exchange.

Phoenix and Elixir make it easy to have tens of thousands of connections on a single server. Each connected Channel and WebSocket in your application has independent memory management and garbage coolection because of OTP processes. An advantage of this process-based architecture is that WebSocket connections eith are not being used often can be stored in a hibernated state, which consumes very little memory.

## Chapter 3

The client will subscribe to topic in server. After that the bidirectional messages can occurs.
One of the benefits of Channels is that they are transport agnostic.
The module that uses Phoenix.Socket has the ability to route topics that the client requests to a provided Phoenix.Channel implementation module. The Channel modue starts up a separate process for each different topic that the user connects to. Channels, like transport processes, are never shared between different connections.
Phoenix.PubSub is used to route messages to and from Channels.

Channels responsabilities:
- Accpet or reject a request to join;
- Handle messages from the client.
- Handle messages from the PubSub.
- Push messages to the client.

Defining a route to a channel:
- Comment any other channel in this file.
- In `user_socket.ex` file add channel "ping", HelloSocketsWeb.PingChannel

Implementing the channel:
- Create file `ping_channel.ex` in channels folder.
- Add the code below:
```elixir
defmodule HelloSocketsWeb.PingChannel do
  use Phoenix.Channel

  def join(_topic, _payload, socket) do
    {:ok, socket}
  end
end
```

Create also a ping event handler in the same file:
```elixir
  def handle_in("ping", _payload, socket) do
    {:reply, {:ok, %{ping: "pong"}}, socket}
  end
```

We are able to do several things when we receive a message:
- Reply to the message by returning {:replay, {:ok, map()}, Phoenix.Socket}. The payload must be a map.
- Do not reply to the message by returning {:noreply, Phoenix.Socket}.
- Disconnect the Channel by returning {:stop, reason, Phoenix}.

Now, install the wscat to send message to server from terminal.
`sudo apt install node-ws`

Execute the following command:
`wscat -c 'ws://localhost:4000/socket/websocket?vsn=2.0.0'`

After connected, send message to server:
> ["1", "1", "ping", "phx_join", {}]
> ["1", "2", "ping", "ping", {}]

and we will see something like:
> ["1", "1", "ping", "phx_join", {}]
< ["1","1","ping","phx_reply",{"response":{},"status":"ok"}]
> ["1", "2", "ping", "ping", {}]
< ["1","2","ping","phx_reply",{"response":{"ping":"pong"},"status":"ok"}]

We first use the special message "phx_join" to connect to the ping Channel using our WebSocket connection. We receive an ok response after the join. We then send the ping Channel a "ping" message with an empty payload. It successfully responds with a pong message.

If we get an error, we need rejoing the channel to work again:
> ["1", "1", "ping", "phx_join", {}]
< ["1","1","ping","phx_reply",{"response":{},"status":"ok"}]
> ["1", "2", "ping", "ping2", {}]
< ["1","1","ping","phx_error",{}]
> ["1", "2", "ping", "ping", {}]
< [null,"2","ping","phx_reply",{"response":{"reason":"unmatched topic"},"status":"error"}]
> ["1", "1", "ping", "phx_join", {}]
< ["1","1","ping","phx_reply",{"response":{},"status":"ok"}]
> ["1", "2", "ping", "ping", {}]
< ["1","2","ping","phx_reply",{"response":{"ping":"pong"},"status":"ok"}]

Note that the connection keep alive.

An error that happens in a single Channel should not affect any other Channels and should not affect the Socket. An error that happens in the Socket, however, will affect all Channels that exist under the Socket because they are dependent on the Socket working correctly.

To simulate an socket error, we can send a wrong message.
> crash
Disconnected (code: 1011, reason: "")

Now, the connection doesn't keep alive.

### Topics

Topics are string identifiers used for connecting to the correct Channel when the "phx_join" message is received by the Socket.

Test effect of topic pattern adding new channel in user_socket file:
`channel "ping:*", HelloSocketsWeb.PingChannel`

Now, connect to a "ping:wild" topic and send messages to it:
`wscat -c 'ws://localhost:4000/socket/websocket?vsn=2.0.0'`
> ["1", "1", "ping:wild", "phx_join", {}]
< ["1","1","ping:wild","phx_reply",{"response":{},"status":"ok"}]
> ["1", "1", "ping:wild", "ping", {}]
< ["1","1","ping:wild","phx_reply",{"response":{"ping":"pong"},"status":"ok"}]

We can put the topic "*" to catch any topic.
Phoenix has a protection to prevent topic creation with any character after, like "ping:*a".
`(ArgumentError) channels using splat patterns must end with *`

Let's create a topic that allows "wild:a:b" where b is an integer that is double the value of a:
- in user_socket.ex add: `channel "wild:*" HelloSocketsWeb.WildcardChannel`;
- create channel:
```elixir
defmodule HelloSocketsWeb.WildcardChannel do
  use Phoenix.Channel

  def join("wild:" <> numbers, _payload, socket) do
    if numbers_correct?(numbers) do
      {:ok, socket}
    else
      {:error, %{}}
    end
  end

  def handle_in("ping", _payload, socket) do
    {:reply, {:ok, %{ping: "pong"}}, socket}
  end

  defp numbers_correct?(numbers) do
    numbers
    |> String.split(":")
    |> Enum.map(&String.to_integer/1)
    |> case do
      [a, b] when b == a * 2 -> true
      _ -> false
    end
  end
end
```

Try it:
`wscat -c 'ws://localhost:4000/socket/websocket?vsn=2.0.0'`
> ["1", "1", "wild:1:2", "phx_join", {}]
< ["1","1","wild:1:2","phx_reply",{"response":{},"status":"ok"}]
> ["1", "2", "wild:1:2", "ping", {}]
< ["1","2","wild:1:2","phx_reply",{"response":{"ping":"pong"},"status":"ok"}]
> ["1", "3", "wild:1:3", "phx_join", {}]
< ["1","3","wild:1:3","phx_reply",{"response":{},"status":"error"}]
> ["1", "4", "wild:20:40", "phx_join", {}]
< ["1","4","wild:20:40","phx_reply",{"response":{},"status":"ok"}]
> ["1", "5", "wild:2:4:6", "phx_join", {}]
< ["1","5","wild:2:4:6","phx_reply",{"response":{},"status":"error"}]


We can define some topic like "notifications:t-1:u-2" to send notifications to user 2 in team 1.

A public Channel providing inventory updates to an e-commerce storefront could be implemented in a variety of ways:
- "inventory" - this topic does not delineate between different SKUs;
- "inventory:*" - this topic delineates between different item SKUs with a wildcard.

### PubSub
Let's see a PubSub example, used to push messages from our application to our Channel.

Execute:
`iex -S mix phx.server`

then, join the channel:
`wscat -c 'ws://localhost:4000/socket/websocket?vsn=2.0.0'`
> ["1", "1", "ping", "phx_join", {}]

in terminal, execute:
```bash
iex(2)> HelloSocketsWeb.Endpoint.broadcast("ping", "test", %{data: "test"})
:ok
iex(3)> HelloSocketsWeb.Endpoint.broadcast("other", "x", %{})
:ok
```

We will see in client terminal the message sent to ping topic, but won't see the other.
> ["1", "1", "ping", "phx_join", {}]
< ["1","1","ping","phx_reply",{"response":{},"status":"ok"}]
< [null,null,"ping","test",{"data":"test"}]

### Send and Receive messages
In this format(["1", "1", "ping", "phx_join", {}]), we have respectively:
- Join ref
- Message ref
- topic
- event
- payload

Let's return different values to the client. First, add function in ping_channel.ex file:
```elixir
def handle_in("ping", %{"ack_phrase" => ack_phrase}, socket) do
  {:reply, {:ok, %{ping: ack_phrase}}, socket}
end
```

Now, we can test it:
`wscat -c 'ws://localhost:4000/socket/websocket?vsn=2.0.0'`
> ["1", "1", "ping", "phx_join", {}]
< ["1","1","ping","phx_reply",{"response":{},"status":"ok"}]
> ["1", "2", "ping", "ping", {"ack_phrase": "hoorays..!"}]
< ["1","2","ping","phx_reply",{"response":{"ping":"hoorays..!"},"status":"ok"}]
> ["1", "2", "ping", "ping", {}]
< ["1","2","ping","phx_reply",{"response":{"ping":"pong"},"status":"ok"}]


Now, let's use pattern matching on the event name:
- change code to:
```elixir
def handle_in("ping:" <> phrase, _payload, socket) do
  {:reply, {:ok, %{ping: phrase}}, socket}
end
```

Try it:
`wscat -c 'ws://localhost:4000/socket/websocket?vsn=2.0.0'`
> ["1", "1", "ping", "phx_join", {}]
< ["1","1","ping","phx_reply",{"response":{},"status":"ok"}]
> ["1", "2", "ping", "ping:flows shows", {}]
< ["1","2","ping","phx_reply",{"response":{"ping":"flows shows"},"status":"ok"}]


### Other Response Types
Add following code in ping_channel.ex file:
```elixir
  def handle_in("pong", _payload, socket) do
    {:noreply, socket}
  end
  
  def handle_in("ding", _payload, socket) do
    # We can use :nomal or :shutdown.
    {:stop, :shutdown, {:ok, %{msg: "shutting down"}}, socket}
  end
```

Try it:
`wscat -c 'ws://localhost:4000/socket/websocket?vsn=2.0.0'`
> ["1", "1", "ping", "phx_join", {}]
< ["1","1","ping","phx_reply",{"response":{},"status":"ok"}]
> ["1", "2", "ping", "pong", {}]
> ["1", "2", "ping", "ding", {}]
< ["1","2","ping","phx_reply",{"response":{"msg":"shutting down"},"status":"ok"}]
< ["1","1","ping","phx_close",{}]


### Pushing messages to a client
This is the default behavior of Channels: any message sent to their topic is broadcast directly to the connected client, BUT we can customize this behavior, however, by intercepting any outgoing messages and deciding how to handle them.

Lets intercept an outgoing ping request. Add the following code in ping_channel.ex file:
```elixir
  def handle_out("request_ping", payload, socket) do
    # Send message to the client without client send a message first.
    push(socket, "send_ping", Map.put(payload, "from_node", Node.self()))
    {:noreply, socket}
  end
```

Stop the server and run:
`iex -S mix phx.server`

We will see the log below:
`lib/hello_sockets_web/channels/ping_channel.ex:24: [warning] An intercept for event "request_ping" has not yet been defined in Elixir.HelloSocketsWeb.PingChannel.handle_out/3. Add "request_ping" to your list of intercepted events with intercept/1`

It occurs because we need specify that the event "request_ping" must be intercepted.
Add the code in ping_channel.ex file:
`intercept ["request_ping"]`

Stop the server and run:
`iex -S mix phx.server`

Join the channel:
`wscat -c 'ws://localhost:4000/socket/websocket?vsn=2.0.0'`
> ["1", "1", "ping", "phx_join", {}]
< ["1","1","ping","phx_reply",{"response":{},"status":"ok"}]


Run the broadcast:
```bash
iex(2)> HelloSocketsWeb.Endpoint.broadcast("ping", "request_ping", %{})
:ok
```

then, the client receive the message:
< ["1",null,"ping","send_ping",{"from_node":"nonode@nohost"}]

It is bes practice to not write an intercepted event if you do not need to customize the payload because it will decrease performance in a system with a lot of subscribers.
